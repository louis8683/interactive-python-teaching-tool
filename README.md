# Interactive Python Teaching Tool

## Welcome! This tool lets you execute a Python program with visualization of the **variable changes** and the **current line of execution**.

#### This is a teaching tool used to visualize how a Python program executes. We believe the visualization of program flow and the visualization of live variable changes can make it easier for new programmers to understand the concepts of programming.

## Features! (in the making)
- Built in Python editor with syntax highlighting.
- Two options for executing: line-by-line or normal full script mode. (You can even scroll through the execution history!)
- Real time variable value display, no more print() for debugging!

### Other features (planning)
- Coding problems and judge system embedded.
- Tutorial videos built inside.
- Advanced visualization (such as trees) to learn about data structures and algorithms.

## How to use?

### Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- Python packages
    - pyside6 (QT for Python)

### Run
> ```PYTHON_PATH run.py```

#### Compile UI
> ```pyside6-uic form.ui > ui_pythoneditor.py```

## What is this project built with?

#### Since this is a project targeted for learning Python, we use as much Python as we could! Including QT with Python (for UI), execution tools (to create the line-by-line details), and other utilities... 

## About the Author

#### I'm a graduate student living in Taiwan (ROC) who has some vision about learning programming and learning Computer Science. Coding can be extremely fun, but also extremely exhausting... I believe this tool can help beginners swiftly ascend beyond the frustration of learning programming and go forward with much more confidence!
